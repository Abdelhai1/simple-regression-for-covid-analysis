# Predictive Model for Forecasting Confirmed Cases

This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast confirmed cases based on historical data. The dataset includes multiple features such as the date, country/region, province/state, and other relevant factors. The goal is to predict the number of confirmed cases using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The model utilizes **XGBoost**, a gradient boosting algorithm, to make predictions. Key steps in this project include:

1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Model performance visualization
5. Communication of results with insights
